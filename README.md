# Canary - Smart musical therapy system

The purpose of the system is to design a low power wearable device that converts real-time sensory data to instrumental music for musical therapy sessions for the patients of dementia.

The wearable device will send accelerometer (ADXL335) and barometer (MPL3115A2) data to the sonification module which is then visualized to a soothing music relating to motion state of the patient and play it using a Bluetooth speaker. Furthermore, this data is sent to Plotly for graphical visualizing of the patientâ€™s motion state.

There is a user interface where the user will be able to control volume of the sound and manage the sonification device. In addition, a care giver can monitor the motion state of the patient through real time plot of movement data of the patient from accelerometer sensor.

Although the initial intention was to design for music-based clinical therapy, it can be used for a wide variety of cases.
